<p><strong>The Hot Runner Controller Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Gate Hot Runner System</li><li>Valve Gate Hot Runner System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hot runner controller market application is mainly divided into two types: the open gate hot runner system and the valve gate hot runner system. The open gate hot runner system is a type of hot runner system that allows the plastic to flow freely through a large, open gate. This system is commonly used for products that require a larger gate size or when the molding process requires a lower injection pressure. On the other hand, the valve gate hot runner system is designed with a valve that controls the flow of plastic into the mold cavity. This system offers precise control over the injection process and is often used for high-quality products with complex designs or for multi-cavity molds.</p></p>
