<p><h1>Passive Transdermal Drug Delivery Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Passive Transdermal Drug Delivery Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Passive transdermal drug delivery is a method of administering drugs through the skin into the systemic circulation. It involves the use of patches that are applied to the skin, allowing the drug to permeate through the various layers of the skin and enter the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. This route of drug delivery offers several advantages, such as improved patient compliance, controlled release of drugs, and avoidance of first-pass metabolism.</p><p>The passive transdermal drug delivery market is expected to witness significant growth during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic pain, is one of the primary factors driving the market growth. Transdermal drug delivery offers a convenient and painless alternative to oral medications, improving patient convenience and adherence to treatment regimens.</p><p>Furthermore, the growing geriatric population and the associated rise in age-related chronic diseases are also contributing to market growth. Elderly patients often face difficulties in swallowing oral medications, making transdermal drug delivery a preferred option. Moreover, advancements in technology, such as the development of innovative patches with enhanced drug release profiles and improved adhesion properties, are further propelling market growth.</p><p>In terms of trends, there is a growing focus on the development of combination patches that can deliver multiple drugs simultaneously. This allows for the management of multiple conditions or the delivery of drugs with synergistic effects. Additionally, the adoption of microneedle-based patches is gaining traction. These patches consist of tiny needles that painlessly penetrate the epidermis, facilitating the delivery of drugs into the deeper layers of the skin.</p><p>In conclusion, the global passive transdermal drug delivery market is expected to witness steady growth during the forecast period, driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and advancements in technology. The development of combination patches and the adoption of microneedle-based patches are some of the emerging trends in the market. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.9% during the forecast period.</p></p>
