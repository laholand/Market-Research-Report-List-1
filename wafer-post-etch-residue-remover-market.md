<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Post Etch Residue Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aqueous Remover</li><li>Semi-aqueous Remover</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wafer post-etch residue remover market includes two main types: aqueous remover and semi-aqueous remover. Aqueous remover refers to a type of solution predominantly composed of water, designed to remove residues left on wafers after etching processes. On the other hand, semi-aqueous remover combines water with organic solvents, creating a mixture that effectively eliminates post-etch residues. Both types serve the purpose of ensuring the cleanliness and quality of wafers after etching, but differ in their composition and effectiveness based on specific requirements.</p></p>
