<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Pump Set Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The agricultural pump set market can be categorized into two types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational energy to move water or other fluids, relying on a rotating impeller to create a vacuum effect that propels the fluid. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, use reciprocating or rotary motion to displace the fluid, trapping it in a chamber and then moving it through an outlet valve. Both types are commonly used in agriculture for irrigation, drainage, and other water-related applications.</p></p>
