<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Manifolds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Choke Manifolds</li><li>Hydraulic Choke Manifolds</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choke manifolds are used in oil and gas industries to control the flow of fluids and prevent excessive pressure buildup. Manual choke manifolds require operators to manually adjust the choke valves to regulate the flow. On the other hand, hydraulic choke manifolds use hydraulic power to automatically adjust the choke valves. Both types serve the same purpose of controlling flow, but hydraulic choke manifolds offer more convenience and efficiency by eliminating the need for manual adjustments.</p></p>
