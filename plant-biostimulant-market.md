<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plant Biostimulant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural</li><li>Biosynthetic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plant biostimulant market can be categorized into two types: natural and biosynthetic. Natural biostimulants are derived from organic materials such as seaweed, humic and fulvic acids, and beneficial soil microorganisms. These substances are rich in nutrients and act as growth promoters and stress relievers for plants. On the other hand, biosynthetic biostimulants are manufactured using chemical synthesis or biotechnological methods. These products are designed to mimic the effects of natural biostimulants and enhance plant growth, root development, and nutrient uptake. Both types aim to improve plant productivity and resilience.</p></p>
