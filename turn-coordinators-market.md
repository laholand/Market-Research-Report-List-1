<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Turn Coordinators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrically Driven</li><li>Air Driven</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Turn coordinators are instruments used in aircraft to determine if the aircraft is properly coordinated during turns. There are two main market types for turn coordinators: electrically driven and air driven. Electrically driven turn coordinators utilize an electric motor to rotate the gyro. These are commonly found in modern aircraft and provide reliable and accurate indications. On the other hand, air-driven turn coordinators rely on the movement of air through a gyroscope to rotate it. This type is typically found in older aircraft and can be less precise than electrically driven models.</p></p>
