<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Plants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Digestion</li><li>Dry Digestion</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biogas plant markets can be categorized into two types: wet digestion and dry digestion. Wet digestion biogas plants utilize organic waste materials, such as sewage sludge and manure, in an oxygen-free environment to produce biogas. This process is ideal for highly-viscous and moist organic waste. On the other hand, dry digestion biogas plants use solid waste materials like crop residues and food waste. These plants operate with low-moisture content and need pre-treatment processes to convert the solid waste into biogas. Both wet and dry digestion processes contribute to sustainable energy production and waste management.</p></p>
