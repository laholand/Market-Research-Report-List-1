<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trench Roller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Capacity</li><li>Large Capacity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trench rollers are used in construction for compacting soil and asphalt in narrow spaces. Small capacity trench rollers are designed for smaller, confined areas where maneuverability is crucial. They have a compact size and lighter weight, making them easier to transport and operate. Large capacity trench rollers, on the other hand, are suitable for larger projects that require high compaction power. They have a larger size and heavier weight, enabling them to provide more force and cover a greater area with each pass. Both types are essential in the construction industry, but their usage depends on the specific project requirements.</p></p>
