<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li><li>Non-invasive Intracranial Pressure Monitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitoring is used to measure the pressure inside the skull. The market is divided into two types: invasive and non-invasive monitoring. Invasive ICP monitoring involves placing a catheter or sensor directly into the brain to measure pressure. This method provides precise measurements but carries the risk of infection. Non-invasive ICP monitoring uses external methods such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate the pressure inside the skull. Although non-invasive methods are safer, they may be less accurate than invasive monitoring.</p></p>
