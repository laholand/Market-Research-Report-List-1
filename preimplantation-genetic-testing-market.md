<p><strong>The Preimplantation Genetic Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preimplantation Genetic Screening</li><li>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) is a form of genetic testing used before implantation of an embryo in assisted reproductive technology. There are two types of PGT: Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS), also known as aneuploidy screening, which checks for abnormalities in the number of chromosomes, and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD), which identifies specific genetic defects in embryos. PGS helps improve the success rate of in vitro fertilization by selecting genetically normal embryos, while PGD is beneficial for couples carrying genetic diseases to prevent their transmission to offspring.</p></p>
