<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Threaded Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded Half Couplings</li><li>Threaded Full Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Threaded couplings are devices used to connect two threaded pipes or fittings securely. There are two main types of threaded couplings on the market: threaded half couplings and threaded full couplings. Threaded half couplings connect two pipes of the same size, providing a threaded end for one pipe while the other end remains open. On the other hand, threaded full couplings have threaded ends on both sides, allowing them to join two pipes of the same size securely. These couplings are commonly used in plumbing, oil and gas, and industrial applications.</p></p>
