<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Nebulizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Pneumatic Nebulizers</li><li>Breath-Actuated Pneumatic Nebulizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic nebulizers are medical devices used to administer medication in the form of a mist that can be inhaled directly into the lungs. There are two main types of pneumatic nebulizers: vented pneumatic nebulizers and breath-actuated pneumatic nebulizers. Vented pneumatic nebulizers require a continuous flow of air or oxygen to aerosolize the medication, while breath-actuated pneumatic nebulizers deliver the medication only when the patient inhales. These different types cater to different patient needs and provide convenient and effective ways of delivering medication for respiratory conditions.</p></p>
