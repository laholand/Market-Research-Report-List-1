<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Three Phase Gas Smart Meter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IC Card</li><li>Non-IC Card</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential three phase gas smart meter market can be categorized into two types: IC Card and Non-IC Card. IC Card meters require an integrated circuit card, similar to a prepaid card, to be inserted into the meter for gas usage. These meters allow consumers to track and control their gas consumption by purchasing and loading credit onto the card. On the other hand, Non-IC Card meters do not require a card, and gas consumption is measured and billed directly without the need for prepayment or credit tracking.</p></p>
