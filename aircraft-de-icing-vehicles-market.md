<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft De-icing Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sprayer</li><li>Spreader</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft de-icing vehicles are specialized equipment used to remove ice or snow from the surface of aircraft during winter or in cold weather conditions. The market for these vehicles can be divided into two types: sprayers and spreaders. Sprayers are equipped with a system that sprays a heated de-icing fluid onto the aircraft, which melts the ice or snow. Spreaders, on the other hand, are designed to spread de-icing materials, such as granular or liquid chemicals, over the aircraft's surface to remove ice or snow. Both types of vehicles play a crucial role in maintaining aircraft safety and operational efficiency in icy conditions.</p></p>
