<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Delivery Microcatheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Lumen Microcatheters</li><li>Dual-Lumen Microcatheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-lumen microcatheters are designed with a single channel for delivering fluids or medications directly to the targeted site. They are commonly used in minimally invasive procedures for precise delivery and navigation within the blood vessels. On the other hand, dual-lumen microcatheters have two separate channels that allow for simultaneous delivery and aspiration of fluids. They are often used in more complex procedures where multiple functions are required, such as in embolization or thrombectomy. Both types play an essential role in the delivery microcatheter market, catering to different clinical needs and preferences.</p></p>
