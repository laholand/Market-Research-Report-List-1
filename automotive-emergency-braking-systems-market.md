<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Emergency Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foot Brake</li><li>Hand Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive emergency braking systems are designed to prevent accidents by automatically applying brakes in critical situations. There are two main types: foot brake and hand brake. The foot brake system is operated by pressing the brake pedal with the driver's foot, activating the braking mechanisms in the vehicle's wheels. On the other hand, the hand brake system is manually engaged by pulling a lever or pressing a button. Both types serve the same purpose of quickly stopping the vehicle to prevent collisions or reduce the severity of an accident.</p></p>
