<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Enzyme Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversible Inhibitor</li><li>Irreversible Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Enzyme inhibitors are compounds that can interact with enzymes and hinder their activity. The enzyme inhibitor market can be categorized into two types: reversible inhibitors and irreversible inhibitors. Reversible inhibitors bind to the enzyme in a temporary manner, allowing the enzyme activity to be recovered once the inhibitor is removed. Conversely, irreversible inhibitors form covalent bonds with the enzyme, resulting in a permanent and irreversible loss of enzyme activity. These inhibitor types provide different options for controlling enzyme function in various applications, such as drug development and industrial processes.</p></p>
