<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Floats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Round Type</li><li>Oval Line Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Barrier floats are commonly used in various water-based activities as a safety measure. There are two main types of barrier floats: round type and oval line type. The round type is a circular-shaped float that is often used to demarcate specific areas in the water, such as swimming zones or recreational areas. On the other hand, the oval line type consists of multiple connected floats forming a line, which is typically used to create a boundary in water bodies, such as in boating or fishing areas. Both types serve to provide visual guidance and prevent people from going beyond designated locations in the water.</p></p>
