<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Towed Array Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Sonar</li><li>Active Sonar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The military towed array sonar market consists of two main types: passive sonar and active sonar. Passive sonar systems are designed to detect and analyze underwater sounds, such as those emitted by submarines, without emitting any signals. This makes them discreet but limits their range and ability to actively track targets. On the other hand, active sonar systems emit sound waves and analyze the echoes to detect and locate underwater objects, providing a longer range and active tracking capability. These types play a crucial role in naval operations for surveillance, detection, and anti-submarine warfare.</p></p>
