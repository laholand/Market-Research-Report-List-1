<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotational Viscometer</li><li>Capillary Viscometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Blood Viscometer market is categorized into two main types: Rotational Viscometer and Capillary Viscometer. </p><p>A Rotational Viscometer measures the viscosity of blood by rotating a spindle or a cone inside a container filled with blood. The resistance to rotation determines the viscosity. This type of viscometer is commonly used in laboratories and medical facilities for blood analysis.</p><p>On the other hand, a Capillary Viscometer measures the viscosity of blood by determining the time it takes for blood to flow through a fine capillary tube. The narrower the capillary tube, the higher the viscosity. This type of viscometer is portable and provides quick results, making it suitable for point-of-care testing.</p></p>
