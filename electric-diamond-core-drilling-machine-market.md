<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Diamond Core Drilling Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Type</li><li>Dry Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Diamond Core Drilling Machine Market consists of two main types: Wet Type and Dry Type. The Wet Type drill utilizes water to lubricate and cool the diamond core bit during the drilling process. This helps to increase the lifespan of the bit and improves drilling efficiency. On the other hand, the Dry Type drill does not require water and instead relies on air or other coolants to cool the bit. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different drilling conditions and materials.</p></p>
